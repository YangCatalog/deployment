# Blank lines and lines starting with pound are comments.

# Explicit mappings match any token sequence on the LHS of "=>"
# and replace with all alternatives on the RHS. These types of mappings
# ignore the expand parameter in the schema.
# Examples:
# i-pod, i pod => ipod,
# sea biscuit, sea biscit => seabiscuit

# Equivalent synonyms may be separated with commas and give
# no explicit mapping. In this case the mapping behavior will
# be taken from the expand parameter in the schema. This allows
# the same synonym file to be used in different synonym handling strategies.
# Examples:
# ipod, i-pod, i pod
# foozball, foosball
# universe, cosmos
# lol, laughing out loud
# If expand==true, "ipod, i-pod, i pod" is equivalent
# to the explicit mapping:
# ipod, i-pod, i pod => ipod, i-pod, i pod
# If expand==false, "ipod, i-pod, i pod" is equivalent
# to the explicit mapping:
# ipod, i-pod, i pod => ipod
# Multiple synonym mapping entries are merged.
# foo => foo bar
# foo => baz
# is equivalent to
# foo => foo bar, baz
